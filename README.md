# Xerox-Project

I started working at a Xerox sales agency as an Inside Sales Rep. The accounts I was given to 

call were almost completely useless: I had zero data on who I was talking to and it also took 

an extremely long time just to load my next account to call with the companies CRM. I suggested 

to them that I build this tool that would provide a rep a streamlined source data so that they could 

both have more effective calls when cold calling and make more. In cold calling it is absolutely critical 

to have an efficient workflow. It was the difference between 30 calls a day and 100 calls in a day!!! 

Xerox eventually found out about this and said "dang son" "that's lit, hows about you do that for 

us and we bring it to all 63 sales agencies across Canada ... I said no ..... way that's awesome!!! 

Let's build some more features that also helps account managers save gas by planning their route more 

efficiently and reducing driving time spent just for the sake of finding where large opportunities exist 

in their territory. Currently working on this as a contract for Xerox in my spare time :):) Check out
